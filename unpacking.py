coordinates =(1,2,3)

#x = coordinates[0]
#y = coordinates[1]
#z = coordinates[2]
# this is the classical way to do it but in python we can use something diffrent called unpacking

x,y,z = coordinates #this is the same way as the above code but using unpacking instead we can use lists aswell not only tuples

print (y)
